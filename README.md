## How It Works
The core functionality of JokeJive involves fetching jokes from the JokeAPI and utilizing the VoiceRSS API to convert the text jokes into speech. The JavaScript code in the script.js file drives this process.

The application also features an interactive button that triggers the joke-fetching process and disables itself during audio playback for a seamless user experience.

**Note:** JokeJive aims to provide light-hearted entertainment through programming jokes. It uses the VoiceRSS API for text-to-speech conversion and the JokeAPI as a source of jokes.

**Remember to replace** `'API_KEY'` with your actual VoiceRSS API key in the JavaScript code, and adjust any other details as needed to match your project setup.
